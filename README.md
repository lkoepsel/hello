# hello - A Raspberry Pi Identity Solution

## Recent Changes (July 7, 2025)

### Service Execution Limit Update - Final Implementation

The hello service has been modified to prevent excessive log file growth and resource usage while ensuring it properly executes 3 attempts per boot cycle.

**Problem Solved:**
- The hello service was running continuously every 10 seconds, creating a significantly large log file
- Service would restart indefinitely on connection failures, consuming system resources
- Initial fix only ran once per boot instead of the intended 3 times

**Final Solution - Changes Made:**

1. **hello.py Script Updates:**
   - **Complete rewrite of execution logic**: Service now performs all 3 attempts within a single execution
   - **Timing**: Makes 3 attempts with 10-second delays between attempts (total runtime ~20 seconds)
   - **Completion tracking**: Uses `/tmp/hello_completed` file to prevent multiple executions per boot
   - **Enhanced logging**: Each attempt clearly labeled as "Starting attempt #1 of 3", etc.
   - **Error handling**: All connection errors logged but don't cause service restarts
   - **Summary reporting**: Final log shows "Completed all 3 attempts. Successful attempts: X/3"

2. **hello.service Configuration Updates:**
   - **Service type**: Changed to `Type=simple` with `Restart=no` 
   - **Single execution**: Service runs once per boot, making all 3 attempts internally
   - **No auto-restart**: Removed restart policies to prevent continuous execution
   - **Maintained functionality**: All original features preserved (log copying, error codes, etc.)

**Current Behavior:**
- ✅ Service executes exactly **3 attempts per boot cycle**
- ✅ **Timing**: Attempt 1 (immediate) → 10s wait → Attempt 2 → 10s wait → Attempt 3 → Complete
- ✅ **Duration**: Service runs for approximately 20 seconds total
- ✅ **Prevention**: Won't run again until system reboot
- ✅ **Logging**: Clear attempt numbering and completion status
- ✅ **Manual restart**: Can be manually started but respects completion limit

**Implementation Details:**
```
Service Start → Attempt #1 → [10s delay] → Attempt #2 → [10s delay] → Attempt #3 → Mark Complete → Exit
```

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All original functionality preserved (IP detection, hostname sending, log copying)
- Same exit codes and error handling for system monitoring  
- No changes to server-side requirements
- Compatible with existing `hello_ip.txt` configuration

**Files Modified:**
- `hello.py`: Complete rewrite of main execution logic
- `hello.service`: Updated service configuration for proper 3-attempt execution

**Formerly know as rasp-mDNS**, *yeah, its clear why I changed the name.*

Recently, the Raspberry Pi Foundation released [Raspberry Pi Connect](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html), which "*provides secure access to your Raspberry Pi from anywhere in the world.*" That's great, except for a couple of issues:
* You need to register. I understand why, however, its a burdensome step to solve such a simple problem.
* Its a *world-wide* solution. I was looking for a *local* solution, one which doesn't **require** connecting to the internet.
* And the deal-killer, it requires the full desktop install. If I need to connect to my Raspberry Pi, more often than not, its in a headless configuration. Headless and desktop are somewhat *antithetical*. 

**Update: July 4th, 2024**
Raspberry Pi has added the ability to perform this on a CLI OS, such as Bookworm (Lite), however, it still seems to be a bit much.
**Update: July 4th, 2024**
Raspberry Pi has added the ability to perform this on a CLI OS, such as Bookworm (Lite), however, it still seems to be a bit much.

## Description
This is a solution for identifying newly programmed, headless *Raspberry Pi (RPi)*'s on a large network. In large networks (*ex: community college*), the wireless network has a significant issue. As network is quite large, it can be difficult to readily identify a *RPi* which has recently joined the network, therefore making it almost impossible to connect to the *RPi*.

## Easy Solution (*macOS* or *Linux*)
There are two, dead-simple, solutions which work well in **small networks** and on *macOS* or *Linux*. *Windows* unfortunately, doesn't do *Bonjour*.:

1. Use the *multicast DNS* service to attempt to connect. This uses the existing solution of [*avahi aka zeroconfig or Bonjour*](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#resolving-raspberrypi-local-with-mdns) to connect with the *RPi*. It works quite well and is the best solution.

It works quite well and is the best solution.

Using the username and hostname you used in programming the SD card with the *Pi Imager* application, try:
```bash
ssh username@hostname.local
```
In large networks this might take a while or not work at all. Worse yet, it doesn't always work. And when it doesn't work, there needs to be a remediation step.

2. To mitigate this issue, try this command: (*replace hostname with the name you provided when programming the SD card*). This command may work faster than attempting to login immediately.
```bash
dns-sd -G v4 hostname.local
```
Example Output:
```bash
DATE: ---Tue 13 Feb 2024---
16:32:22.348  ...STARTING...
Timestamp     A/R  Flags IF  Hostname      Address     TTL
16:32:51.715  Add  2.    17  pisan.local.  192.168.1.  120
```
Notice that the IP address is provided in the second line of *192.168.1.6*

```bash
# Connect to the board using the IP address
ssh 192.168.1.6
# after a warning regarding the "...authenticity of host..." and a few seconds, you will see the CLI prompt.
```

And the second step might not work, either. Leaving you with a *RPi*, which is on the network, however, you are unable to connect to it.

## The *hello* Solution - Run a service on Raspberry Pi
A third all-encompassing solution is to implement an auto-connecting application on startup, **on the remote *RPi***. This application will ping a local server (your PC or another *LAN-based* host *RPi*) with its host name and IP address. This ensures you have ready access to the remote *RPi* without having to go through determining its IP address. 

This solution will work due to the ability to save your server's IP address on the *RPi*, prior to boot. This means the *RPi* is trying to find you, instead of vice-versa. 

Once implemented, the steps to connect in a new network are:
1. Determine the IP address of your host system.
2. Using any platform, *Windows*, *macOS* or *Linux*, enter the IP address into a specific file on the *RPi* SD card.
3. Place the SD card in the RPi and power it up. Start the hello_server application on your host system and wait for the *ping*.

## Installation
### 1. Requirements
#### 1.1 Host System (Your PC or a host *RPi*)
*Python* and the *flask* library. If you don't have *flask* installed and encounter the new Python requirement to run in a virtual environment...you may install it system-wide with *sudo apt install python3-flask* on *Debian* (or *Raspberry Pi Bookworm*).

#### 1.2. Raspberry Pi (remote *RPi*)
Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm (or later)

### 2. Create a hello.service on the remote Raspberry Pi
Create a startup application, which will ping a server by *IP address* and report **its own** host name and IP address.

#### 2.1.. Create hello.py
This is the program which executes as part of the *hello.service*. Open a Python file, then copy/paste contents below into file:
```python
# open a file named hello.py
sudo nano /usr/bin/hello.py
```
Paste the following contents then Ctrl-S, to save and Ctrl-X to exit *nano*.
```python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    exit_code = main()
    sys.exit(exit_code)
```
*Ctrl-S* (save) *Ctrl-X* (exit)

#### 2.2. Add IP address of the host server to the remote *RPi* boot folder
This step identifies your PC by IP address to the Raspberry Pi:

##### **On your PC or host *RPi***

Run either server program (*simple_server.py or hello_server.py*), and it will report the host IP address.
```bash
python -m hello_server
Cleaned 12 test entries from database
 * Serving Flask app 'hello_server'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://192.168.1.49:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit

```
The IP address to use, is the one **which is not 127.0.0.1**, in this case it is *192.168.1.49:5000*. 

##### **On the remote *RPi***

Open the file which will contain the IP address.

```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/hello_ip.txt
```

Enter the only the numeric IP address of your PC WITHOUT a return at the end of the line. The file *hello_ip.txt* will need to look like:

```bash
192.168.1.49:5000
```
*Ctrl-S* (save) *Ctrl-X* (exit)

**Note:** By storing the IP address in a file at */boot/firmware*, you may access the file on a macOS or Windows system. The *boot/firmware* folder shows up as a readable folder on either system called *bootfs*. This enables you to change the IP address on your PC then re-insert the SD card into the *RPi* to ping you at a new address. 

There is also a file on *boot/firmware* called *hello.log*, which you can open with a text editor. It will contain the log entries for the *hello.service*. Use these entries if you are having difficulty getting a ping from the *RPi.*

Due to some permissions issues, the hello.log is created on both the /home/lkoepsel folder as /home/lkoepsel/hello.log and /boot/firmware/hello.log. The latter is copied from the former after the service runs. If your are attempting to read the file from a non-Raspberry Pi filesystem, then use /boot/firmware, otherwise, it might be easier to read the /home/lkoepsel version.

#### 2.3. Setup `systemd` unit file for hello.py service
This will execute the *hello.py* app, after all other startup services have been executed on the RPi. 

The service will log entries to */boot/firmware/hello.log* on the *RPi* or */bootfs/hello.log* when examining the SD card on a Mac/Windows system. Use it to determine any issues with the service.

You may use the command `journalctl -b`, to see all boot messages of the *RPi*. or use `journalctl -b | grep hello`, to see all messages related to the service.

You can use the space bar, to quickly go through screens of lines. Look for the word DEBUG as the *hello.py* application uses logging to print messages.

#### hello.service
Same as above, use nano to create file, copy/paste contents below then exit *nano*. 

```bash
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/hello.service
```

Copy/paste contents below into the file:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Ping a known server (hello_ip.txt) with hostname and IP address (3 times per boot)
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Exit nano using *Ctrl-S* *Ctrl-X*

#### 2.4 Run the following commands to create service and test it. 

(*It helps to go to step 3 on your host system and confirm the hello message appears*):

```bash
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/hello.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# enable the service so that it runs on all subsequent systems boots
sudo systemctl start hello.service
sudo systemctl status hello.service
```

#### 2.5 Enable the service to run on startup. (IMPORTANT)
```bash
# if hello.service is running well, then enable to run on boot
sudo systemctl enable hello.service
```

Additional commands which will be helpful, later once the service is running:
```bash
# determine if the hello.service is running
sudo systemctl status hello.service

# stop the hello.service, useful if you want to stop pinging server
sudo systemctl stop hello.service

# restart the hello.service, this will stop then start the service
sudo systemctl restart hello.service
```
## Pick 3a or 3b below based on your needs.
### 3a. Simple Version (Good for single *RPi* connections)
The simple version is useful for single *RPi* connections. Using a terminal program on your PC, use one tab to connect to your hello_server system (typically a host *RPi* or your PC) and the second tab to connect to the remote *RPi* in question. Once this repository is installed on the host *RPi*, follow the steps below:
1. Run `python -m simple_server` on the host *RPi*.
2. Ensure the remote *RPi* has the hello.service running.
3. Reboot the remote *RPi*.

In your host tab, once the remote *RPi* has been rebooted, you should see the following:
```bash
...
* Running on http://192.168.1.49:5000
...
speedy
192.168.1.112 - - [29/Nov/2024 08:54:40] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

The *running on* message is the IP address of the server *RPi* and the two lines with *speedy* are the hostname and IP address of the remote *RPi*.

### 3b. Enhanced Version with Database: Run hello_server.py
This enhanced version stores all connections in a SQLite database and provides a web interface showing hostnames, IP addresses, and timestamps. It includes several improvements:

- Persistent storage of connections in a SQLite database
- Local time display for each connection
- Clean web interface using MVP.css
- Command line options for cleaning database of old entries

#### Installation

The server can be started with the following options:
```bash
# Normal start
python hello_server.py

# Reset database (clears all entries)
python hello_server.py --reset
```

#### Features
- **Database Storage**: All connections are stored in a SQLite database (`messages.db`)
- **Local Time**: Timestamps are stored and displayed in local time
- **Web Interface**: Clean, responsive interface showing:
  - Hostname
  - IP Address
  - Last Update (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM format)
- **Database Management**:
  - Automatic cleanup of test entries
  - Command line option to reset database
  - Persistent storage between server restarts

#### Security Notes
- The server listens on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) to allow LAN connections
- Only runs on the local network, not exposed to the internet
- Database is stored locally and can be reset if needed

### NOTES
#### Permissions Issue
If you might get the following response:
```bash
python3 -m hello_server
 * Serving Flask app 'hello_server'
 * Debug mode: on
Permission denied
```

In the example above, I've changed the port from 80, the typical *http* port, which requires sudo permissions to *5000*.

#### Install Flask

Two Options:

##### Better: uv install
```bash
# install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# source env
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
# initialize uv
uv init
# add flask
uv add flask
# run hello server
uv run python hello_server.py
```

##### Global Install 
If you need to install *flask*, and get the new *externally-managed-environment* as in:
```bash
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install....
```

I recommend you follow the advice on a Linux system and simply use *sudo apt install python3-flask*, to install *flask*.
 
#### Example Output of hello_server.py:
```bash
python serverv2.py
 * Serving Flask app 'serverv2'
 * Debug mode: on

## Initial instance
There is a "chicken/egg" problem which can occur. If you can't initially connect to the *RPi*, how do you add the *hello* solution?

1. My immediate solution is to connect 1:1 with the Raspberry Pi, using an ethernet cable. This creates a two element network, my PC and my *RPi*. Then apply the steps above.
2. Next up from that is to initially use the *RPi* in a small network, where its easier to connect.
3. A third solution is to create an installable image which already contains the hello service. The make this the standard image you use, going forward. I'll detail the steps here:
### Creating a Raspberry Pi OS hello image
*You will need to do this in a small network or tightly coupled setup as described in solution #1 above.*

1. Use Pi Imager to write the Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) to an SD card or USB drive. In the OS Customization tab, I've provided the hostname of *hello* and as I know it will be my image, I add my publickey on the Services tab.
2. Once written, I put the SD card into my *RPi*, wait for it to boot sufficiently then login `ssh hello.local`.
3. I follow the steps above, and once I've confirmed the service works well. I create a new image:
### Saving, shrinking and sending an image
I use a Linux laptop to perform the following steps. You can use your Raspberry Pi, however, you will need several smaller USB drives to hold the images prior to shrinking them.
```bash
# remove SD card or USB drive containing RPi image and place in Linux PC
# determine physical device
lsblk
# find specific drive "sdc", "sdd" which is the right size of RPi drive, use as input
sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=./pibuildv3.img bs=1M status=progress
# shrink the size of the image to save space
sudo pishrink.sh -avz pibuildv3.img
wormhole send pibuildv3.img.gz
```

## Notes
1. If the *RPi* isn't connecting, it might be a problem with startup. The service logs to */boot/firmware/hello.log*.  If you are unable to access the Pi, you may shutdown the *RPi* and examine the file via a Mac or Windows system. It will be at the root level of the */bootfs* folder.
1. If you are able to access the Pi, you may `cat /boot/firmware/hello.log` or use `journalctl -b | grep hello` to examine the startup log for *hello.service* entries. 
1. Implementing the optional solution, allows you to change networks and identify your PC's new IP address. Mount the SD card on your PC and edit /bootfs/hello_ip.txt, replacing the IP address with the new one. Put the SD card back into the *RPi*, run `python hello_server.py` then boot the *RPi*. It will ping your server with its new address.
1. If you have multiple *RPI*'s and want to confirm which one is which, run `sudo du -h /`, which prints the size of all folders to the screen. This will make the green led light for several seconds.
1. When using *RPi Imager* software, use *Shift-Ctrl-X* to bring up the options screen.
1. Once you've confirmed you no longer need the *RPi* pinging the server, you can stop it with *sudo systemctl stop hello.service*. The service is designed to stop running once it has successfully pinged a server.
1. As Windows has difficulty using *Bonjour*, you could consider nmap as an alternative to identify *Raspberry Pi*'s on your network. [nmap Windows Version](https://nmap.org/download.html#windows)
